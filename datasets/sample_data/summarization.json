Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables computers to learn from data \n            without explicit programming. Deep learning, which uses neural networks with multiple layers, has achieved \n            remarkable breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing. Companies \n            are investing billions of dollars in AI research and development, while governments are creating policies \n            to regulate its use. Despite the benefits, concerns about job displacement, privacy, and algorithmic bias \n            remain significant challenges that society must address.",

      "document": "Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges of our time. Global temperatures have risen \n            by approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius since the late 19th century, primarily due to human activities such \n            as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. The impacts are already visible: melting ice caps, rising sea \n            levels, extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \n            Change (IPCC) warns that limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C requires rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, \n            land, urban infrastructure, and industrial systems. Solutions include renewable energy adoption, energy \n            efficiency improvements, carbon pricing, and international cooperation through agreements like the Paris \n            Climate Accord.",
